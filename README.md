## Introduction

A radically new UI layout paired with goodies like a Darkmode will give your Drupal's Admin interface a facelift. The Gin theme also includes things which are currently out of scope for Claro and/or some customisations we're experimenting with for the future. Built on the foundation of Claro from one of the lead designers of Claro & Drupal Design System.

Gin can be used in a headless environment, as it provides a nice [login screen](https://drupal.org/project/gin_login) which is missing in the default Drupal admin themes.

- For a full description of the module, visit the [project page](https://www.drupal.org/project/gin).
- Use the [Issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/gin) to submit bug reports and feature suggestions, or track changes.
- Documentation can be found [here](https://www.drupal.org/docs/contributed-themes/gin-admin-theme).
## Requirements

This theme requires Drupal core >= 9.0.

**Note**: For all functions to work properly, it is recommended that you also install [Gin Toolbar](https://drupal.org/project/gin_toolbar).

## Installation

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal theme. See [Gin documentation](https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/content/gin-admin-theme/installation-and-configuration) or visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.

### Set Gin as default admin theme

 - Navigate to Admin > Appearance
 - On the same page, click "Install" under Gin
 - At the bottom of the page, switch the Administration theme to Gin

`npm run dev`

- Compile assets (for dev branch)\
`npm run build`
